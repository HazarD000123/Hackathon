# Hackathon

Code: 
1. It opens up a GUI asking the user to enter the user ID and password. This credentials are verified with the database (spreadsheet) and the user gets logged in.
2. User clicks on report to report an issue. User enter the details which triggers an email.

Exceptions: 
1. The location and the dog condition is entered through the terminal at the moment. However the existing code can be modified to input the data through the GUI.
2. The authentication is happening by cross verifying the user input with a database (from a spreadsheet).
